Identifiers can also contain escaped characters and any ISO 10646 character as a numeric code (see next item). For instance, the identifier \"B&W?\" may be written as \"B\\&W\\?\" or \"B\\26 W\\3F\".\n\n// In Summary:\n// a name must begin with an underscore (_), a hyphen (-), or a letter(a–z), followed by any number of hyphens, underscores, letters, or numbers. There is a catch: if the first character is a hyphen, the second character must2 be a letter or underscore, and the name must be at least 2 characters long.\n","export enum SUB_COMPONENT_CSS_MODES {\n
