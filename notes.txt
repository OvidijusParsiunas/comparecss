Modal:
Have a default button, then when it is clicked, have the modal
Activate button, that turns into lock when active and you hover over it
consider having a dropdown to choose which border side to edit
have a builder for contents within the settings
modal default margin will need to have a special option type to reflect the margin of the actual position, also an option to center it automatically
javascript to close the alert message
test in slower pc if the child dropdowns displays options correctly - chrome/firefox
ability to remove the layers
the x button should close the modal
maybe clicking outside of the modal should close it too
esc button
enter - submit/cancel - potential - call the option 'actions'
when hovering over option that only works in expanded modal view - higlight the toggle for it
potentially rename initial to default convention
potentially add x button to border coloring
clicking on an option again to remove settings panel
button size is not set in settings correctly
maybe each equal section should be selectable
consider making alert and button into a separately generated compontes in component preview as their contents shake when size is changed in firefox
text alignment not working
option for font weight and text overlay, should also have an icon to edit text in-line, also can potentially have an icon for remove
fix the nested button display layout - to access their text
dropdown for the button component
remove vuesax
need to change subcomponentType - to subcomponentName
work to be done - WORK1
when subcomponents are deleted, the overlay should not appear when hovering the subcomponent dropdown

option to import an existing button style!

when changing the range and clicking the right mouse button causes the popover to disappear
potentially have animation for when optional subcomponent options buttons appear and are hidden
the alert button ripple does not seem to work properly when there are many components

UX:
  on using the select key for picking a subcomponent, check whether the mouse should always be a pointer, marked with UX - SUBCOMPONENT SELECT
  on expanded modal mode toggle open and close transitions, does the toolbar needs to fade in and out with the same duration as modal, marked with UX - EXPANDED MODAL TOGGLE TRANSITION
  is the new blue color preview good enough
  enter behaviour ok in new componant modal?
  check if switching component modes to default but leaving same option is ok for UX
  see if the subcomponent add and subcomponent remove hover and active css is ok
  check if position option in the modal is ok to use

update the range using the scroll wheel
need a color for when settings are partially-disabled (the user can change them which will turn them to the original color) - this is more-so for cases where the modal is
  set to be centered and the top range is not used and vice versa, also would provide use for disabling modal animations etc as no good way to disable that at the moment
  this would also be useful for just partially disabling backdrop opacity when the color is romoved instead of setting it to 0
ability to group the components
option to see what the actual css looks like and to edit it
consider placing javascript unique to the css classes it was used on
sometimes setting to auto option like the margin does not set desired results, potentially remove it - or set beginner components (in modal) to have no margin as auto
decide where the display code and download buttons should go

font-awesome pictures on buttons
material design examples should have nice hover, and shadow increase events on mouse click
button to switch between px, em (at the moment optimization is only configured for px)
if button height exceeds certain threshold - only then should the 'Centered' setting be displayed in the 'Text' panel

when designing a component library the users may want to use the same component and define different styles for it using a parameter

not far from a website builder, all we need is the ability to add subcomponents and that's it
at the moment there are finite layers per component as we need to know which one is the first, last etc in order to set the correct settings such as border property - top/bottom and shadow
that can easily be changed to allow user to set border for any side they want (dropdown for border), shadow can allow any side offset (already used in components)
the current infrastructure does not support layers within layers in the component preview and the subcomponent dropdown

---------------------------------------------------

Future work

Room for optimising the exported css file contents to reuse repeated css properties
Allow the button to have its text vertically centered for all heights via the use of a class without the need for it to be applied to a button tag:
Currently works with the button tag only, this is due to the fact that if we are using <div> or <a> - we need to use display: table-cell property which does not allow for the use of margins.
One solution would be to automatically apply padding as the button height is increased - so as to make the text look like it is vertically centered.
This would use the following equation: (total button height - text height) / 2 = padding top and padding bottom pixels.

use composition functions to make them shearable - https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/10/reactivity-in-vue-3/ https://composition-api.vuejs.org/#logic-extraction-and-reuse
  note: they are only good for utilising lifecycle handlers like onMounted and onUnmounted within the function

use native implementation of vuesax when it is compatible with vue 3

reference css component versions - uikit v3 - in popover when hovering logo

try to use css asset files so you can lazy load them
statistics should include size and github popularity
think about having loading placeholders when the images are loading up for cards

when an alert close button doesn't work - have a toaster message appear to say that this functionality is not provided out of the box

https://startbootstrap.com/previews/simple-sidebar/ - phone feature

make the panels order switchable via options popover or drag and drop

Maybe have multiple cards flying randomly with different framework logos
