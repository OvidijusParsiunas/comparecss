Modal:
Have a default button, then when it is clicked, have the modal
Activate button, that turns into lock when active and you hover over it
consider having a dropdown to choose which border side to edit
have a builder for contents within the settings
modal default margin will need to have a special option type to reflect the margin of the actual position, also an option to center it automatically
javascript to close the alert message
test in slower pc if the child dropdowns displays options correctly - chrome/firefox
when clicking option button then dragging mouse out, text disappears

firefox colour picker does not change the colour
redundant mapping for subcomponentTypeToPreviewId, just do string theres

option to import an existing button style!

potentially have animation for when optional subcomponent options buttons appear and are hidden
create a custom select options element in new component modal body

the alert button ripple does not seem to work properly when there are many components
clean up css after export, such as 0px values, bordershadow being unset - be careful not to remove transition

UX:
  on using the select key for picking a subcomponent, check whether the mouse should always be a pointer, marked with UX - SUBCOMPONENT SELECT
  is the new blue color preview good enough
  enter behaviour ok in new componant modal?
  check if switching component modes to default but leaving same option is ok for UX

need to investigate how to set default settings values (min max, select options) for each subcomponent
cursor that allows user to hover over component's parts and upon clicking would direct to the rightful settings (similar to what chrome has)
color active toolkit button
option to see what the actual css looks like and to edit it
consider placing javascript unique to the css classes it was used on
sometimes setting to auto option like the margin does not set desired results, potentially remove it - or set beginner components (in modal) to have no margin as auto
decide where the display code and download buttons should go

font-awesome pictures on buttons
material design examples should have nice hover, and shadow increase events on mouse click
button to switch between px, em (at the moment optimization is only configured for px)
if button height exceeds certain threshold - only then should the 'Centered' setting be displayed in the 'Text' panel

when designing a component library the users may want to use the same component and define different styles for it using a parameter

not far from a website builder, all we need is the ability to add subcomponents and that's it
at the moment there are finite layers per component as we need to know which one is the first, last etc in order to set the correct settings such as border property - top/bottom and shadow
that can easily be changed to allow user to set border for any side they want (dropdown for border), shadow can allow any side offset (already used in components)
the current infrastructure does not support layers within layers in the component preview and the subcomponent dropdown

---------------------------------------------------

Future work

Room for optimising the exported css file contents to reuse repeated css properties
Allow the button to have its text vertically centered for all heights via the use of a class without the need for it to be applied to a button tag:
Currently works with the button tag only, this is due to the fact that if we are using <div> or <a> - we need to use display: table-cell property which does not allow for the use of margins.
One solution would be to automatically apply padding as the button height is increased - so as to make the text look like it is vertically centered.
This would use the following equation: (total button height - text height) / 2 = padding top and padding bottom pixels.

use composition functions to make them shearable - https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/10/reactivity-in-vue-3/ https://composition-api.vuejs.org/#logic-extraction-and-reuse
  note: they are only good for utilising lifecycle handlers like onMounted and onUnmounted within the function

use native implementation of vuesax when it is compatible with vue 3

reference css component versions - uikit v3 - in popover when hovering logo

try to use css asset files so you can lazy load them
statistics should include size and github popularity
think about having loading placeholders when the images are loading up for cards

when an alert close button doesn't work - have a toaster message appear to say that this functionality is not provided out of the box

https://startbootstrap.com/previews/simple-sidebar/ - phone feature

make the panels order switchable via options popover or drag and drop

Maybe have multiple cards flying randomly with different framework logos
